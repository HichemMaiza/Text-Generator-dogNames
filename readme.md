# Text Generation

The goal of this project is to train a one Character level language model to automatically generate
text (dogs Names).

## Data set

The model was trained on the dog names [dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dog-names) of the `Municipality of Anchorage â€” Names of registered dogs from Anchorage Animal Care and Control as of 10/17/2017 in the Municipality of Anchorage`.

```csv
DogName, Count
BELLA,111
BUDDY,81
SADIE,69
BAILEY,65
```

## Generate a cool name for your dog

1. clone repo

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/deepKratos/dogNamesGenerator.git
    ```

2. create a virtual environment

    ```shell
    python -m venv myenv
    cd myenv\Scripts\
    activate
    ```

3. install the dependencies

    ```shell
    pip install numpy
    ```
4. Execute the code

    The script takes one parameter, how many names to generate. For example, I'd like to generate five names, I'll pass 5

    ```shell
    python dogGenerator.py 5
    ```

    this is my try ;)  

    ```shell
    Kuke
    Fare
    Uika
    Bee
    Jeinie
    ```
